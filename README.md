The project aims to achieve this by creating awareness and by providing public education programmes that highlight the risks and consequences of alcohol abuse and misuse amongst those that take to drinking .And particularly among the youth many who take to drinking without the realization of what they are getting into. woman-saying-no-to-drinking.jpg Mission  In it
